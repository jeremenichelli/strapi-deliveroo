Example application with Strapi as CMS and Next.js on the frontend

## Project

The structure contains a `backend` folder, run `npx strapi start` or `npx strapi develop` to kick off the CMS server and backend controllers needed for the app to work.

In another terminal, go to `frontend` and run `yarn dev` to start the user interface.
